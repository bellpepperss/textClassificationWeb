Disclaimer:
While this model is designed to classify text as "Fake" or "True" based on available data, it is not infallible. The model may make mistakes or misclassify content due to limitations in the training data, nuances in language, or evolving misinformation tactics. Users should not rely solely on the model's output for decision-making. It is recommended to verify information from multiple trusted sources.
